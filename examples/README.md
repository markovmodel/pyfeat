pyfeat-examples
===============

We have comprised a series of examples to illustrate the functionality of
pyfeat and how it can be used for different stationary estimators to compute
free energies and probabilties. 

Content
-------

* Asymetric double well potential - simulated with 2 different simulation 
protocols: Temperature replica exchange and umbrella sampling


How to start the examples
-------------------------

Make sure you have ipython notebooks installed (if not you can get it via
the python anaconda distribution for example)
Then go to your terminal and type:

<pre><code>ipython notebook double_well_example.ipynb</code></pre>
