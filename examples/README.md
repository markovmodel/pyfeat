pyfeat-examples
===============

We have comprised a series of examples to illustrate the functionality of
pyfeat and how it can be used for different stationary estimators to compute
free energies and probabilties. 

Content
-------

* Assymetric double well potential - simulated with 3 different simulation 
protocols: Temperature replica exchange, Umbrella sampling, Hamiltonian 
replica exchange


How to start the examples
-------------------------

Make sure you have ipython notebooks installed (if not you can get it via
the python anaconda distribution for example)
Then go to your terminal and type:

<pre><code>ipython notebook double_well_example.ipynb</code></pre>
